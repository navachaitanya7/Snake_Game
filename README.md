## Overview

This Java Snake game provides a basic, playable version of the popular arcade game. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without the snake colliding with the walls or itself.

## Features

* Simple and intuitive gameplay.
* Graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing.
* Basic score tracking.
* Randomly generated food placement.
* Game over condition when the snake hits a wall or itself.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2.  **Download:** Download the Java source files (e.g., `SnakeGame.java`, `GamePanel.java`, `Food.java`, `Snake.java`). These files should be in the same directory.
3.  **Compilation:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the source files, and compile the Java code using the following command:

    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

4.  **Execution:** After successful compilation, run the main `SnakeGame` class using:

    ```bash
    java SnakeGame
    ```

    This will launch the Snake game window.

## Controls

The snake is controlled using the following keyboard keys:

* **Up Arrow Key:** Move the snake upwards.
* **Down Arrow Key:** Move the snake downwards.
* **Left Arrow Key:** Move the snake to the left.
* **Right Arrow Key:** Move the snake to the right.

## Game Logic

* The game starts with a small snake on the game board.
* Food appears randomly on the board.
* When the snake's head collides with the food, the snake grows longer, and the score increases. New food is then generated at a random location.
* The game ends if the snake's head collides with the walls of the game board or with any part of its own body.
* The current score is typically displayed on the game window.

## Code Structure

The project likely consists of the following Java classes:

* **`SnakeGame.java` (Main Class):**
    * Sets up the main game window (JFrame).
    * Creates an instance of the `GamePanel`.
    * Handles window closing and other top-level configurations.

* **`GamePanel.java`:**
    * Extends `JPanel` and implements `ActionListener` and `KeyListener`.
    * Contains the core game logic, including:
        * Drawing the snake, food, and game board.
        * Handling user input for snake movement.
        * Updating the game state (snake position, food location, score).
        * Checking for collisions (walls and self).
        * Implementing the game loop (using a `Timer`).

* **`Snake.java`:**
    * Represents the snake object.
    * Stores the coordinates of the snake's body segments (likely using `ArrayList` or arrays).
    * Provides methods for moving the snake, growing, and checking for self-collision.

* **`Food.java`:**
    * Represents the food object.
    * Stores the coordinates of the food.
    * Provides a method for generating new random food locations.

## Potential Enhancements

This basic Snake game can be further enhanced with the following features:

* **Difficulty Levels:** Implement different game speeds.
* **Obstacles:** Add static or moving obstacles to make the game more challenging.
* **Power-ups:** Introduce items that grant temporary advantages (e.g., increased speed, invincibility).
* **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for eating food, collisions, and game over.
* **High Score Tracking:** Store and display the highest scores.
* **More Sophisticated Graphics:** Improve the visual appearance of the game.
* **Menu System:** Implement a menu for starting a new game, adjusting settings, and viewing high scores.
